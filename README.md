Exploratory Data Analysis and model prediction on Customer churn

Terminologies used:
1. churned customers - customers who fail to become a repeated user of a product, thereby leaving for another product
2. active customers - customers currently using the product
3. LTV - Life time Value

#Project Briefing

Steps involved in the Customer Churn Project:
1. Gathering of a teleco dataset.
2. Data cleaning.
3. Exploratory data analysis/ story telling.
4. Model prediction on Customer.

Exploratory Data Analysis#
 > Data visualization plots to gain more insights on the following research questions:
  1. Average life time value and tenure for active customers.
  2. Average life time value and tenure for churned customers.
  3. Proportion of services utilized by the active and churned customers.
  4. Determining what feature among the demographics affected the churned and active customers long term value the most?
  5. Internet services subsets affecting the customers LTV the most and how it could be solved.

MODEL Prediction#
  1. Selection of target variable.
  2. Selection of predicted values.
  3. Hypertuning the model for best paramaters to increase model performance.
  4. Model evaluation.
  5. Saving the model.
